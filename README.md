# Hope-16-Conference-Workshop

I will provide the files and links to files + the VM for the workshop sometime this week.
<br>
<br>I did in the meantime today create an impromptu workshop #2. Since, there was a lot of interest in linux systems programming after the workshop I created these basic exercises leading up to a process injection to get your feet wet on the subject.
<br>Feel free to check it out.
<br>
<br>Here are some book recommendations for learning linux systems programming and incident response.

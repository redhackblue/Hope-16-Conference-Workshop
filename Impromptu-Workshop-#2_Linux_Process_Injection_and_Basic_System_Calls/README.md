# Hope-16-Conference-Workshop #2 Linux Process Injection and System Calls

In this workshop you will run through 6 basic linux system call exercises using fork, execl, read, write, open, ptrace, etc. culminating in a basic process injection using ptrace.
There is also an included Trend Micro Intel Report from July 2025 covering Reptile. A linux rootkit that also uses process injection.
Each exercise prints out the status as the program executes so you can see the changes. I encourage you to try and run the programs change, add to them, etc. so you can understand what is occuring.
The Walk through should help with understanding each exercise as well.
